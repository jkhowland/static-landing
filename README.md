Static Landing
==============

The Static Landing index page will take content from 3 sources:

**1) Posts of "Type:Featured"** Each post of type featured will have Title, Subtitle, Image (link), and then a text body. 

**2) Post of "Type:Introduction"**Each post of type introduction will have a Title and then a text body. 

**3) Posts of "Type:Portfolio"** Each post of type portfolio will have Title, Subtitle, Icon (link) and Image (link) and then a text body. 


I think the best thing to do would be to build this as 3 separate plugins:

**1)** A plugin that takes "Type:Featured" posts and makes a carousel out of them.

**2)** A plugin that takes "Type:Portfolio" posts and makes them into the square posts.

**3)** A plugin that makes the Index page take the featured, introduction, and portfolio content.

Note: The index page should also include a form from a mailchimp.html and use the google analytics plugin as well.



The blog should be very simple. An example would be http://harpoonapp.com/blog

**1)** A simple index2+ page that lists 8 posts. (with a pagination for older posts)

**2)** Article pages that include newsletter signup, recent article list, and Twitter link. 

**3)** No need for category, Tags, or archive pages.
