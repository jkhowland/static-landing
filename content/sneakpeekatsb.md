We searched for professional Pelican and Jekyll themes and couldn't find any we liked. So we gathered some talented designers and started building something beautiful. We're trying to create static website themes that you would be proud to call your own. Even more importantly we're trying to create static website themes that will blow your clients away.

Take a look at some of the countless reasons to choose static over a 'blogging platform' below. While you're at it, sign up for a sneak peek at the theme's we're creating. We're excited to show you what we've been building.
