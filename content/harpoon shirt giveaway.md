**Update:** We had some problems with our signup form when this article was first posted. So if you signed up on our mailing list, but didn't receive an email confirmation please sign up again to get in on the t-shirt giveaway. Sorry about that!

To celebrate our upcoming launch we're giving away a handful of snazzy Harpoon t-shirts. We'll pick the winners from our mailing list later this month, and then announce the lucky folks in a future blog post. These shirts will be genuine collectors' items some day, sure to be selling on eBay for tens of dollars! So sign up on the mailing list for a chance to be the envy of the neighborhood. Good luck!
